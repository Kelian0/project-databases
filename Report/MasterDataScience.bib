  abstract = {As a core branch of financial forecasting, stock forecasting plays a crucial role for financial analysts, investors, and policymakers in managing risks and optimizing investment strategies, significantly enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of economic decision-making. With the rapid development of information technology and computer science, data-driven neural network technologies have increasingly become the mainstream method for stock forecasting. Although recent review studies have provided a basic introduction to deep learning methods, they still lack detailed discussion on network architecture design and innovative details. Additionally, the latest research on emerging large language models and neural network structures has yet to be included in existing review literature. In light of this, this paper comprehensively reviews the literature on datadriven neural networks in the field of stock forecasting from 2015 to 2023, discussing various classic and innovative neural network structures, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Large Language Models (LLMs). It analyzes the application and achievements of these models in stock market forecasting. Moreover, the article also outlines the commonly used datasets and various evaluation metrics in the field of stock forecasting, further exploring unresolved issues and potential future research directions, aiming to provide clear guidance and reference for researchers in stock forecasting.},

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {Although we have witnessed great success of pre-trained models in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), limited progress has been made for general time series analysis. Unlike NLP and CV where a unified model can be used to perform different tasks, specially designed approach still dominates in each time series analysis task such as classification, anomaly detection, forecasting, and few-shot learning. The main challenge that blocks the development of pre-trained model for time series analysis is the lack of a large amount of data for training. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging language or CV models, pre-trained from billions of tokens, for time series analysis. Specifically, we refrain from altering the self-attention and feedforward layers of the residual blocks in the pre-trained language or image model. This model, known as the Frozen Pretrained Transformer (FPT), is evaluated through fine-tuning on all major types of tasks involving time series. Our results demonstrate that pre-trained models on natural language or images can lead to a comparable or state-of-the-art performance in all main time series analysis tasks, as illustrated in Figure 1. We also found both theoretically and empirically that the self-attention module behaviors similarly to principle component analysis (PCA), an observation that helps explains how transformer bridges the domain gap and a crucial step towards understanding the universality of a pre-trained transformer.
